- User Authentication: Secure user registration and login with JWT-based authentication and role-based access (User/Admin).
- Product Catalog Management: Enable admins to add, edit, and delete products with categories, variants (e.g., Yellow Maize), export-specific fields (HS Code), featured flags, and multiple image uploads.
- Category Management: Allow admins to manage product categories, set featured categories, and toggle active/inactive status.
- Order Management: Enable admins to view order details and update order status (Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered), including toast notifications for updates.
- Product Recommendations: Suggest related products to the customer by inspecting the current product viewed.
- Cart and Checkout: Implement full cart functionality, allowing users to add/remove items, update quantities, view order summaries, enter address details, select a payment gateway (Stripe/Razorpay), and place orders with toast notifications for success.
- User Profile: Allow users to view and manage their profile, orders, and checkout options.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#4CAF50) to evoke a sense of agriculture and natural products.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a very slightly desaturated version of the primary color, to provide a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#FFC107), analogous to the primary green, for highlights and call-to-action buttons.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a serif, providing an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel to headings; body text: 'PT Sans', a sans-serif, will ensure comfortable reading of longer content.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clean, professional icons representing different product categories and actions. The icons should align with the export theme.
- Maintain a clean and modern layout with clear sections for navigation, product display, and user information. Ensure responsiveness across devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience. Use toast notifications for all major actions.
